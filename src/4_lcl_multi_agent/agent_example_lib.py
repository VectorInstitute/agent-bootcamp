    Based on your 2025 promotional plan, here is an analysis of underperforming items and recommendations for your 2026 plan.

    Underperforming Items in 2025
    The primary underperforming item in your 2025 promotional plan is:

    Catelli Glaze 650ml: This product consistently showed a significant negative margin lift in all its promotions, with losses ranging from approximately -$76,427 to -$117,552. This indicates that promoting this item has been highly unprofitable.
    Recommendations for 2026 Promotions
    To improve your promotional margin in 2026, I recommend adding items that have demonstrated a strong, positive response to promotions. Based on 2025 performance, the following items are highly recommended:

    Unico Red Spread Aged: This product was a top performer, generating a margin lift between $46,847 and $53,122 during its promotions.
    Kraft Hard Dairy Shredded: This was another strong performer, with a margin lift ranging from $48,429 to $50,125.
    By replacing the underperforming "Catelli Glaze 650ml" with high-performing products like "Unico Red Spread Aged" and "Kraft Hard Dairy Shredded," you can significantly improve the profitability of your 2026 promotional plan."
